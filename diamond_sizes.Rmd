```{r setup, include = FALSE}

## Diamonds - ggplot

We have data about **`r nrow(diamonds)`** diamonds[^1]. Only *`r nrow(diamonds) - nrow(smaller)`* are larger than 2.5 carats. The distribution of the remainder is shown below:

[^1]: The data set is supplied as an example data set within the ggplot package.

```{r carat_freqplot, echo = FALSE}
smaller %>% 
  ggplot(aes(carat)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.01)
```

Notice in the above plot that there are almost regular spikes. There tend to be higher numbers of diamonds cut at 'human friendly' carat sizes: 1/2 carat, 1 carat, 1 1/2 carat, etc.

## Cars - formatted tables

```{r table_example, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  mtcars[1:5, ], 
  caption = "Example output from Motor Trend Cars (mtcars) data set."
)
```
